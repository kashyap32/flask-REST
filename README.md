# flask-REST

In computing, representational state transfer (REST) is the software architectural style of the World Wide Web. More precisely, 
REST is an architectural style consisting of a coordinated set of architectural constraints applied to components, 
connectors, and data elements, within a distributed hypermedia system.


To the extent that systems conform to the constraints of REST they can be called RESTful. RESTful systems typically,
but not always, communicate over Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) with the same HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) 
that web browsers use to retrieve web pages and to send data to remote servers
